## Where in the world?

A website that uses the REST Countries API to display country information.

The user can search for a country, filter countries by region, and see more info about a specific country.

## Tech used
- Nextjs
- Tailwind
- REST COUNTRIES api
- Typescript
- Vercel

### Some things I learned
- using React context to fetch info once and store it to be used elsewhere
- page transitions, specifically creating a skeleton card and having those show up as the page loads
- utilized co-pilot for the first time
- not using type 'any' anywhere!! which is why we use typescript in the first place...
